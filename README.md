Pistachio
==========
Lightning fast, strong consistency distributed key value store system. Linearly scalable, strong consistency, HA, light weight, support plugin of physical storage engine. Especially great for in-memory distributed storage system. It's being used in large scale ad serving system in Yahoo, supporting millions of QPS, thousands of servers. Availabilty and consistency have been proven.

Pistachio is also being used in large scale distributed compute to achieve much better data locality. We saw 10s times performance resource efficiency improvement than our map reduce jobs.
